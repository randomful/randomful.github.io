(1+ answers);MULTI;A value proposition canvas;A Gantt chart;A stakeholder map;A customer value flowchart;1,4;Value models are used to align the product to stakeholder goals. The guide mentions value proposition canvas, value model, mean value charts, and customer value flowcharts as examples that achieve this. Guide to POA, Ch. 6.26 Value Modelling.
Obsess About Value;What is the most critical role of a Product Owner in ensuring a product delivers the right value through each iteration?;SINGLE;To write all the code for the product.;To ensure the product always delivers the right value by continuously aligning it to evolving customer needs and market forces.;To prevent any changes to the product backlog once an iteration has started.;To manage the project's budget and timeline.;2;The most critical role of a Product Owner is to ensure that the product always delivers the right value. This requires a continuous process of aligning the product with evolving customer needs and market forces. Guide to POA, Ch. 5.7.1.2 Assess Market Alignment.
Obsess About Value;A team is struggling to prioritize their backlog because every stakeholder claims their request is the most important. The PO needs a collaborative way to force trade-offs. What is an effective next step?;SINGLE;The PO should make all prioritization decisions in isolation.;Facilitate a "Buy a Feature" game with the stakeholders.;Build the feature requested by the loudest stakeholder first.;Ask the development team to choose the features they think are most important.;2;Buy a Feature is a collaborative game where stakeholders are given a budget to "buy" the features they want most. It forces them to make trade-off decisions and reveals what is truly most valuable to them as a group. Guide to POA, Ch. 6.17 Product Backlog Management.
Obsess About Value;A product team introduces a new support channel that is initially costly but is projected to increase long-term customer retention and value. When leadership questions the immediate negative impact on the bottom line, what financial concept can the PO use to justify the decision?;SINGLE;Scope Creep;Internal Rate of Return (IRR);Technical Debt;Daily Active Users (DAU);2;The PO can argue that while immediate costs are high, the feature is a long-term investment. Using a metric like IRR can show that the projected future returns justify the initial cost, framing it as an investment. Guide to POA, Ch. 5.7.1.3 Assess Financial Viability.
Obsess About Value;A team is designing a transactional feature, like a checkout process. They want to focus on the common user goal and outcome, rather than the specific persona performing the action. Which requirement format is best suited for this?;SINGLE;A Job Story;A Use Case;A Persona;A Non-Functional Requirement;1;Job stories focus on the "jobs to be done" and are ideal for capturing common activities, transactions, and workflows where the user's motivation and outcome are more important than their specific role or persona. Guide to POA, Ch. 6.10 Job Stories.
Obsess About Value;A PO is prioritizing features for an upcoming release. They identify a feature that offers high customer value and has a low development complexity. How should this feature be categorized?;SINGLE;A strategic initiative that should be planned for a later release.;A low-priority item that can be placed at the bottom of the backlog.;An easy win that should be prioritized for early delivery.;A candidate for removal from the backlog.;3;When using a Value vs. Complexity analysis, high-value, low-complexity features are considered easy wins. They provide a great return on investment and should be prioritized for quick delivery. Guide to POA, Ch. 6.17 Product Backlog Management.
Obsess About Value;What does the term "intangible value" refer to in the context of a product?;SINGLE;Value that can be precisely measured in monetary terms, like revenue.;Value that cannot be easily quantified, such as reducing customer complexity or providing delight.;Value that is only relevant to the development team.;Value that is derived from the product's technical architecture.;2;Value can be tangible (cost-saving, revenue) or intangible. Intangible value is difficult to quantify but critically important, and includes benefits like reducing complexity or providing a delightful customer experience. Guide to POA, Ch. 5.7 Obsess About Value.
